Putting all of her energy into her last steps of the running 
race, Jamie crossed the finish line. To her disappointment, she
had failed to beat her personal best time, again. Jamie had 
pushed herself for months to finally break her record, but it 
was all for nothing. Recognizing how she felt about her 
failure, Ken, her teammate, approached her and said, “Jamie, 
even though you didn’t set a personal best time today, your 
performances have improved dramatically. Your running skills 
have progressed so much! You’ll definitely break your personal 
best time in the next race!” After hearing his comments, she 
felt confident about herself. Jamie, now motivated to keep 
pushing for her goal, replied with a smile. “You’re right! Next
race, I’ll beat my best time for sure!”
